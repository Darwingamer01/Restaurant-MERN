# Next Steps - Restaurant MERN

## Sprint 1: Backend Core Implementation

### 🎯 Sprint 1 Goals
Implement core backend functionality including authentication, database models, and API endpoints.

### 📋 Sprint 1 Tasks

#### Authentication System
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation middleware

#### API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication routes
- [ ] `/api/v1/dishes/*` - Menu management
- [ ] `/api/v1/users/profile` - User profile management
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for all models

#### Database & Seeding

- Input validation with Zod on all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### 📦 Expected Deliverables
- Working authentication system
- Complete database models with validation
