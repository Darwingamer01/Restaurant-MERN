# Next Steps - Restaurant MERN

## Sprint 1: Backend Core Implementation

### 🎯 Sprint 1 Goals
Implement core backend functionality including authentication, database models, and API endpoints.

### 📋 Sprint 1 Tasks

#### Authentication System
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation middleware
- [ ] Create login/register endpoints with Zod validation
- [ ] Add refresh token rotation strategy
- [ ] Implement password hashing with bcryptjs
- [ ] Add logout functionality with token blacklisting

#### Database Models
- [ ] Complete User model with authentication methods
- [ ] Create Dish model with category and availability fields
- [ ] Implement Reservation model with date/time validation
- [ ] Add Order model with items and pricing calculation
- [ ] Create Coupon model with usage tracking
- [ ] Implement Review model with approval workflow

#### API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication routes
- [ ] `/api/v1/dishes/*` - Menu management
- [ ] `/api/v1/users/profile` - User profile management
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for all models

#### Database & Seeding
- [ ] Enhanced seed script with sample dishes and coupons
- [ ] Database indexing for performance
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Error handling and validation

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for authentication middleware
- [ ] Integration tests for auth endpoints
- [ ] Model validation tests
- [ ] API response format tests

### 🔧 Technical Requirements
- All passwords must be hashed with bcryptjs (12 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens: access (15min), refresh (7 days)
- Input validation with Zod on all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### 📦 Expected Deliverables
- Working authentication system
- Complete database models with validation
- Seed script with realistic test data
- Test suite with >80% coverage for auth module
- Updated OpenAPI specification
- Postman collection for API testing

### 🚦 Sprint 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] User can register and login successfully
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] Database seed creates admin user and sample data
- [ ] All authentication tests pass
- [ ] API endpoints return consistent response format
- [ ] Health check endpoint shows database connection status

### ⚠️ Blockers & Dependencies
- MongoDB Atlas connection string required in `.env`
- JWT secrets must be generated and added to environment
- Shared package must be built before backend development

### 🔄 Handoff to Sprint 2
After Sprint 1 completion:
- Backend API will be fully functional for authentication
- Database will be seeded with test data
- Frontend can begin implementing login/register forms
- Shared types will be validated against actual API responses

2. **Short-term (Sprint 2)**: Build frontend authentication UI
3. **Medium-term (Sprint 3-4)**: Core restaurant features
4. **Long-term (Sprint 5-6)**: Production deployment and optimization

### Key Decisions Pending
- Email service provider for notifications (Sprint 4)
- Error monitoring service selection (Sprint 5)
- Analytics and metrics tracking (Sprint 4-5)
- Mobile responsiveness testing strategy (Sprint 2-3)

### Resources Needed
- MongoDB Atlas cluster (already setup guide provided)
- Cloudinary account for image management
- Razorpay account for payment processing
- Unsplash API key for food images
- Vercel and Render accounts for deployment (Sprint 5)
